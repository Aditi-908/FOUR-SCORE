       <big> <strong>Let our experience and training work for you!</strong> </big>
    </br>
As women, our self-defense training consisted of having been taught not to hit or fight back. That someone else will protect us. Unfortunately, the statistics show that the “someone else” usually turns out to be our attacker/abuser.
</br>
We face multiple challenges and obstacles as women when seeking self-defence and personal safety training. The largest obstacle for most women is finding a competent, quality, no testosterone bs filled, training site with skilled, competent, easy going professional women's self-defense trainers who understand the challenges we face as women and what we will, and won’t do, in our defense. And most importantly, who can make us laugh and relax while still tackling a serious subject.
</br>
That’s where Women’s Self-Defense Institute excels. We present information in clear, concise training formats so you can easily walk out of class and immediately implement the self-defense training strategies you’ve learned.
</br>
Most people believe it takes years to learn effective women's self-defense. Well, it doesn’t. We can empower you by giving you the skills and confidence you need to identify, avoid and survive crime by preparing you both mentally and physically for today’s violence.
</br>
Women’s Self-Defense Institute is the only complete women’s self-defense system in the world. By “complete” we mean that you will learn not only how to survive violence, but how to recognize pre-conflict indicators and to be aware of post-conflict dangers. We provide you with the tools to handle these situations.
</br>
So who enrolls in our women's self-defense programs, whether it is a lunch and learn seminar, a half day self-defense program, or a multi-week training regimen? Basically, everyone: single women, college-students, housewives, business professionals, mothers, black belts, police, military personnel, travelers, survivors of crime, nurses, high school & middle school girls, girls scouts, soccer players, churchgoers, and any other woman who has a need and desire to ensure her own personal safety.
