            One day I was returning very late from my office. The roads were deserted and I was feeling very unsafe. Out of the blues, I regisered on Veerangana and asked for  a transport so that I can go back home. Surpriingy, within 5 minutes, an auto was sent which real time traacker that tracked my GPS location as each and every point of time. More over, the driver suggested me tto video call any one  of my family member. In no time, I reached my home safely. Thankyou Veerangana!
